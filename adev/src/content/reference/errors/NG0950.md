# Required input is accessed before a value is set.

@description
A required input was accessed but no value was bound.

This can happen when a required input is accessed too early in your directive or component.
This is commonly happening when the input is read as part of class construction.

Angular will set required inputs at earliest in the `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook.
Consider working with the input in `ngOnInit` or at a later time.

## Fixing the error

Access the required input in `ngOnInit` or later.
Alternatively, switch away from a required input and specify an initial value.
